# Prayer Times Database
Flat file + JSON database to make prayer times data (location and timings) readily available/accessible on GitHub and open-source.

IMPORTANT: Refer to [LICENSE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ruqqq/prayertimes-database/master/LICENSE) for terms of use.

# Changelogs
**28/12/2016**
Initial framework/tools/data commit using data from PrayerTime.sg (sourced out from MUIS PDFs).

# How to Use
Minimally, the data set can be used by directly linking  [data.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ruqqq/prayertimes-database/master/data.json) file in your web/app and do local parsing.

Otherwise, you can download the data onto your (web/mobile/desktop) app and do client-side processing and storing. (Hint: You are free to create syncing tool if you decide to keep a version of the data locally). Please refer to LICENSE for more info on restrictions on the usage of the data.
